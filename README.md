# ModeMateApp
I will create a mobile app that allow users to log their mood, the goal of this project is to develop a mobile application that enables
users to log their mood at regular intervals throughout the day. By doing so, the app will help users gain insight into their typical and
changing moods, which can be a valuable tool for personal growth and self-awareness.
Overall, this app has the potential to be a valuable tool for anyone looking to gain a better understanding of their mood and how it
changes over time.
